#Topic 1: Voltage, Current, Resistance & Ohm’s Law

---

## 🔋 Voltage (V)
- Voltage is the potential difference between two points.
- It’s what pushes electrons to move.
- Voltage is the reason electrons want to move.
- **No voltage = no push = no flow**

---

## 🔌 Current (I)
- Current is the flow of electrons.
- It’s measured in **amperes (A)**.
- Current is like the number of electrons moving past a point per second.

---

## 🔧 Resistance (R)
- Resistance is what **opposes the flow of current**.
- Measured in **ohms (Ω)**.
- **Copper** → low resistance  
- **Rubber** → high resistance  
- Resistance slows down current.

## 📏 Ohm’s Law
\[
V = I \times R
\]

Derived formulas:
- \[
I = \frac{V}{R}
\]
- \[
R = \frac{V}{I}
\]
