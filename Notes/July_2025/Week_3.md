# 🧪 Topic 1 : Practical Simulation of Ohm’s Law using Tinkercad

---

## 🔩 Components Needed
- 🔋 Battery  
- 🔘 Resistor  
- 💡 LED  
- 📟 Multimeter  
- 🧵 Wires  

---

## 🔌 Connections
- Connect **-ve side of battery** to **cathode of LED**.  
- Connect **anode of LED** to **one side of resistor**.  
- Connect **the other side of the resistor** to the **+ve terminal of battery**.

---

## 🔍 To Measure Current
- Break the wire between **+ve terminal of battery** and the **resistor**.  
- Keep the **multimeter in series**.  
- Connect **red terminal** of the multimeter to the **+ve terminal of the battery** and the **black terminal** of the multimeter to the **resistor**.

---

## ⚡ To Measure Voltage
- Keep the **multimeter in parallel** to the resistor.  
- Connect **black terminal** of multimeter to the **-ve side of the resistor**.  
- Connect **red terminal** of multimeter to the **+ve side of the resistor**.  
- Otherwise, we will get **-ve voltage**.

Now measure both and check according to **Ohm’s Law**:  
> **V = I × R**

---

## 🧾 1st Observation
- **R** = 220 Ω  
- **I** = 30.9 mA  
- **V** = 6.79 V  
 - I × R = 6.79
#### So, V = IR

---

## 🧾 2nd Observation
- **R** = 560 Ω  
- **V** = 6.97 V  
- **I** = 12.4 mA  
- I × R = 6.94 V

## 📌 Observations
- ➕ As **resistance increases**, **current decreases**.  
- 🔋 **Voltage stays the same** if the battery is constant.  
- 💡 **LED brightness** also varies with current – **dimmer with more resistance**.
